## 🏗️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| React 18 | UI framework |
| Tailwind CSS | Utility-first styling |
| Recharts | Data visualizations |
| Lucide React | Icon library |
| Context API + useReducer | State management |
| localStorage | Data persistence |

## 🧠 Architecture & Approach

### State Management
All application state lives in a single `AppContext` (Context API + `useReducer`). Actions are dispatched for every state change — adding/editing/deleting transactions, switching roles, updating filters, toggling dark mode, and tab navigation. `useMemo` ensures derived values (filtered transactions, summary totals) are only recomputed when dependencies change.

### Role-Based UI
Roles are simulated entirely on the frontend via a toggle in the sidebar:

- **Admin** — can add, edit, and delete transactions. Sees action buttons in the table.
- **Viewer** — read-only. Add/Edit/Delete buttons are hidden. A "View Only" badge appears on the dashboard.

No backend or auth is involved — this is a pure UI simulation as required.

### Data Persistence
On first load, 72 realistic mock transactions (Jan–Jun 2025, Indian Rupee, across 10 categories) are seeded into `localStorage`. All subsequent add/edit/delete operations persist to `localStorage` immediately, so data survives page refreshes.

### Visualizations
Four charts are implemented using **Recharts**:
1. **Area Chart** — Monthly income vs expenses trend (time-based)
2. **Donut/Pie Chart** — Spending breakdown by category (categorical)
3. **Bar Chart** — Net balance per month (monthly comparison)
4. **Radar Chart** — Spending pattern across top categories (insights)

### Responsiveness
- Sidebar collapses to icon-only mode on smaller screens
- Summary cards switch from 4-column to 2-column grid
- Charts use `ResponsiveContainer` to fill available width
- Table scrolls horizontally on mobile

---

## 📊 Insights Logic

The Insights page auto-generates observations from the data:

- **Top spending category** — highest total expense category with % share
- **Month-over-month change** — % change in expenses between the last two months
- **Savings rate alert** — flags if savings rate drops below 10% or celebrates if ≥ 20%
- **Best month** — month with the highest net balance
- **Monthly table** — full breakdown with income, expenses, net savings, and rate badge

---

## 🌗 Dark / Light Mode

Toggle available in the sidebar footer. The preference is applied immediately and persists through the session (can be extended to localStorage easily).

---

## 📤 Export

From the Transactions page, use the **Export** dropdown to download:
- `transactions.csv` — filtered results as CSV
- `transactions.json` — filtered results as JSON

Exports always reflect the current filter state.

---

## 🔮 Potential Enhancements

- Connect to a real backend (Node + Express, Supabase, Firebase)
- Persist dark mode preference in localStorage
- Add budget/goal tracking per category
- Email summary reports
- Multi-currency support
- Advanced date range presets (This Month, Last 30 Days, YTD)
